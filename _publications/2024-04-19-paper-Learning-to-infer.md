excerpt: 'Accurate estimation of weather conditions across a large area is crucial but challenging due to the complex and chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Traditional methods rely on combining observations with forecasts, which can be computationally expensive and sensitive to model biases. We propose a new approach called Climate Inpainting (CLIN) that learns the inherent spatial patterns of the atmosphere from climate data using machine learning techniques. CLIN can effectively combine the learned patterns with limited observations to reconstruct complete spatial maps of weather variables, such as temperature. We demonstrate that CLIN can accurately reproduce the key spatial features and variability of temperature over East Asia. Moreover, CLIN can quantify the uncertainty in the estimated weather maps and evaluate the importance of each observation site in reducing the overall uncertainty. This information can guide the optimal design of weather station networks. Our approach showcases the potential of machine learning in utilizing the rich information contained in climate data to improve weather estimation and observation planning.'

I'm a doctor student from [School of Earth and Space Sciences (ESS)](https://en.ess.ustc.edu.cn/), [The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My research focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in atmospheric science, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of various Earth system processes.

My primary areas of interest include:

* Data Assimilation: Integrating observational data with numerical/data-driven models to improve the accuracy and reliability of weather and climate predictions.
* Weather Forecasting: Applying deep learning algorithms to address the challenges of forecasting in a highly dynamic and chaotic atmosphere.
* Climate Modeling: Utilizing AI-driven methods to simulate and analyze long-term climate variability and predict future climate scenarios.

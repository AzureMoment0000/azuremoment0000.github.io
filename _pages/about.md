I'm a Ph.D. student from [School of Earth and Space Sciences (ESS)](https://en.ess.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My primary research objective is ***the application of deep learning techniques in atmospheric science***, with the goal of enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of simulation and forecasting of various Earth system processes.

My primary areas of interest include:

* **Data Assimilation**: Integrating observational data with numerical/data-driven models to improve the accuracy and reliability of weather and climate predictions.
* **Weather Forecasting**: Applying deep learning algorithms to address the challenges of forecasting in a highly dynamic and chaotic atmosphere.
* **Climate Modeling**: Utilizing AI-driven methods to simulate and analyze long-term climate variability and predict future climate scenarios.
